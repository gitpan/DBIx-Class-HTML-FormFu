0.01005 2008-06-19

    - Deprecated - use HTML::FormFu::Model::DBIC instead

0.01004 2007-10-03

	- Changed back to using named methods, as get_column / set_column 
	  doesn't call the DBIC inflators / deflators.
	- Added a CAVEATS section to docs, explaining the issues.

0.01003 2007-09-24

	- Use has_column() and set_column() instead of can() to ensure we don't 
	  delete a record, instead of updating a column named 'delete'!

0.01002 2007-09-21

	- Fix for Checkboxes for NOT NULL columns
	- Copy Form->params(), so it's not changed

0.01001	2007-08-22

	- First CPAN release
